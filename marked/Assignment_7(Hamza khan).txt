  "feedback": "The student's code correctly implements the required functions but has some issues. The indentation in the `calculate_total_cost` function is inconsistent, and the tax rate should be fixed at 5% instead of being input by the user. Additionally, the palindrome function could be improved by using a more descriptive name. Overall, the logic is sound, but attention to detail is needed."
