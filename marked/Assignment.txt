  "feedback": "The code is well-structured and implements the required functionalities effectively. However, there is a minor issue in the `calculate_total_cost` function where the price list is passed as a tuple instead of a list. Additionally, the variable name 'taxt' in the palindrome function could be more appropriately named 'text' for clarity."
